Structure of the Project
          - doc : documentation
          - images : image of works
          - src : Arduino C program

# Power Supply
Most important : Battery-Spot-Welder use the main 220Vac power supply. Super important to isolate the grounds. Pay attention.

# High voltage power supply sharing ground with high voltage input
 * High voltage in to Diac

# High voltate input specs
 * 240VAC 50Hz
